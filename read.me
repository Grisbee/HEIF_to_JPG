Simple app for saving .HEIC formatted images as .jpg for easier use with older software or hardware (for example TVs) not compatible with .HEIC extension.

Place your HEIC photos in /input/ directory. Don't worry about files with other extensions (like .mov or already existing .jpg files), they will be automatically moved to /output/ directory without any changes.
After running the script the now-jpg-converted images will be saved in /output/ directory
